   When upgrading from a previous release, please be aware of the following
   incompatible changes:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Buildbot no longer supports Python 2, as support was dropped upstream in
     version 2.0.0. Configurations may need to be modified to make them
     compatible with Python 3.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     PostgreSQL now uses
     <filename class="directory">/run/postgresql</filename> as its socket
     directory instead of <filename class="directory">/tmp</filename>. So
     if you run an application like eg. Nextcloud, where you need to use
     the Unix socket path as the database host name, you need to change it
     accordingly.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      The options <option>services.prometheus.alertmanager.user</option> and
      <option>services.prometheus.alertmanager.group</option> have been removed
      because the alertmanager service is now using systemd's <link
      xlink:href="http://0pointer.net/blog/dynamic-users-with-systemd.html">
      DynamicUser mechanism</link> which obviates these options.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      The NetworkManager systemd unit was renamed back from network-manager.service to
      NetworkManager.service for better compatibility with other applications expecting this name.
      The same applies to ModemManager where modem-manager.service is now called ModemManager.service again.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      The <option>services.nzbget.configFile</option> and <option>services.nzbget.openFirewall</option>
      options were removed as they are managed internally by the nzbget. The
      <option>services.nzbget.dataDir</option> option hadn't actually been used by
      the module for some time and so was removed as cleanup.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      The <option>services.emby.enable</option> module has been removed, see
      <option>services.jellyfin.enable</option> instead for a free software fork of Emby.

     See the Jellyfin documentation:

     IPv6 Privacy Extensions are now enabled by default for undeclared
     interfaces. The previous behaviour was quite misleading — even though
     the default value for
     <option>networking.interfaces.*.preferTempAddress</option> was
     <literal>true</literal>, undeclared interfaces would not prefer temporary
     addresses. Now, interfaces not mentioned in the config will prefer
     temporary addresses. EUI64 addresses can still be set as preferred by
     explicitly setting the option to <literal>false</literal> for the
.     interface in question.

     Since Bittorrent Sync was superseded by Resilio Sync in 2016, the
     <literal>bittorrentSync</literal>, <literal>bittorrentSync14</literal>,
     and <literal>bittorrentSync16</literal> packages have been removed in
     favor of <literal>resilio-sync</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
     The corresponding module, <option>services.btsync</option> has been
     replaced by the <option>services.resilio</option> module.

     The httpd service no longer attempts to start the postgresql service. If you have come to depend
     on this behaviour then you can preserve the behavior with the following configuration:
     <literal>systemd.services.httpd.after = [ "postgresql.service" ];</literal>
    </para>
    <para>
     The option <option>services.httpd.extraSubservices</option> has been
     marked as deprecated. You may still use this feature, but it will be
     removed in a future release of NixOS. You are encouraged to convert any
     httpd subservices you may have written to a full NixOS module.
    </para>
    <para>
     Most of the httpd subservices packaged with NixOS have been replaced with
     full NixOS modules including LimeSurvey, WordPress, and Zabbix. These
     modules can be enabled using the <option>services.limesurvey.enable</option>,
     <option>services.mediawiki.enable</option>, <option>services.wordpress.enable</option>,
     and <option>services.zabbixWeb.enable</option> options.

     The option <option>systemd.network.networks.&lt;name&gt;.routes.*.routeConfig.GatewayOnlink</option>
     was renamed to <option>systemd.network.networks.&lt;name&gt;.routes.*.routeConfig.GatewayOnLink</option>
     (capital <literal>L</literal>). This follows

    <para>
     Whenever the usage of the module is detected the evaluation will fail with a message
     explaining why and how to deal with the situation.
    </para>
    <para>
     A new knob named <literal>nixops.enableDeprecatedAutoLuks</literal>
     has been introduced to disable the eval failure and to acknowledge the notice was received and read.
     If you plan on using the feature please note that it might break with subsequent updates.
    </para>
    <para>
     Make sure you set the <literal>_netdev</literal> option for each of the file systems referring to block
     devices provided by the autoLuks module. Not doing this might render the system in a
     state where it doesn't boot anymore.

      The <literal>prometheus-nginx-exporter</literal> package now uses the offical exporter provided by NGINX Inc.
      Its metrics are differently structured and are incompatible to the old ones. For information about the metrics,

       By default, prometheus exporters are now run with <literal>DynamicUser</literal> enabled.
       Exporters that need a real user, now run under a seperate user and group which follow the pattern <literal>&lt;exporter-name&gt;-exporter</literal>, instead of the previous default <literal>nobody</literal> and <literal>nogroup</literal>.
       Only some exporters are affected by the latter, namely the exporters <literal>dovecot</literal>, <literal>node</literal>, <literal>postfix</literal> and <literal>varnish</literal>.

       The <literal>ibus-qt</literal> package is not installed by default anymore when <xref linkend="opt-i18n.inputMethod.enabled" /> is set to <literal>ibus</literal>.
       If IBus support in Qt 4.x applications is required, add the <literal>ibus-qt</literal> package to your <xref linkend="opt-environment.systemPackages" /> manually.

       The CUPS Printing service now uses socket-based activation by
       default, only starting when needed. The previous behavior can

       The <option>services.pdns-recursor.extraConfig</option> option has been replaced by

     No service depends on <literal>keys.target</literal> anymore which is a systemd
     target that indicates if all <link xlink:href="https://nixos.org/nixops/manual/#idm140737322342384">NixOps keys</link> were successfully uploaded.
     Instead, <literal>&lt;key-name&gt;-key.service</literal> should be used to define
     a dependency of a key in a service. The full issue behind the <literal>keys.target</literal>
     dependency is described at <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/67265">NixOS/nixpkgs#67265</link>.

     <para>
       The <option>security.acme.directory</option> option has been replaced by a read-only <option>security.acme.certs.&lt;cert&gt;.directory</option> option for each certificate you define. This will be
       a subdirectory of <literal>/var/lib/acme</literal>. You can use this read-only option to figure out where the certificates are stored for a specific certificate. For example,
       the <option>services.nginx.virtualhosts.&lt;name&gt;.enableACME</option>  option will use this directory option to find the certs for the virtual host.
     </para>
     <para>
       <option>security.acme.preDelay</option> and <option>security.acme.activationDelay</option> options have been removed. To execute a service before certificates
       are provisioned or renewed add a <literal>RequiredBy=acme-${cert}.service</literal> to any service.
     </para>
     <para>
       Furthermore, the acme module will not automatically add a dependency on <literal>lighttpd.service</literal> anymore. If you are using certficates provided by letsencrypt
       for lighttpd, then you should depend on the certificate service <literal>acme-${cert}.service></literal> manually.
     </para>
     <para>
       For nginx, the dependencies are still automatically managed when <option>services.nginx.virtualhosts.&lt;name&gt;.enableACME</option> is enabled just like before. What changed is that nginx now directly depends on the specific certificates that it needs,
       instead of depending on the catch-all <literal>acme-certificates.target</literal>. This target unit was also removed from the codebase.
       This will mean nginx will no longer depend on certificates it isn't explicitly managing and fixes a bug with certificate renewal
       ordering racing with nginx restarting which could lead to nginx getting in a broken state as described at 
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/60180">NixOS/nixpkgs#60180</link>.

     from all NixOS modules included in a given
     <literal>configuration.nix</literal> configuration file. Currently, it is
     set to <literal>false</literal> by default as enabling it frequently
     prevents evaluation. But the plan is to eventually have it set to
     <literal>true</literal> by default. Please set it to
     <literal>true</literal> now in your <literal>configuration.nix</literal>
     and fix all the bugs it uncovers.

     The <literal>vlc</literal> package gained support for Chromecast
     streaming, enabled by default. TCP port 8010 must be open for it to work,
     so something like <literal>networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 8010
